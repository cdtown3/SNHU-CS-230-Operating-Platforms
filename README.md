# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room owns a game called Draw It or Lose It. When they initially came to us Draw It or Lose It was only available on Android. The Gaming Room requested that we come up with a plan to expand Draw It or Lose It's community to multiple platforms like iOS, Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The app would be a web application that works over web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, etc... Draw It or Lose It also contains a login system, and so we needed to think about security features as well.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I was able to understand the client's needs, interpret them into UML designs, and create a development document that gives plenty of knowledge to the team. I think my interpretation worked well in the "design contstraints" area of the document as well. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
To have everything you need laid out in one document is incredibly useful. There are certainly times when more information is needed, but to be able to reference the design document during times of confusion has proven to be essential.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Probably the "evaluation" part of the document. I don't think I fully understood what was needed in this section when I started. I may have overthought it to be honest. After getting feedback from the instructor I felt that I understood what was required much better. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Considering the user's needs is essential for product satisfaction. I think I was able to create a list of recommendations that would fulfill each of the user's needs and more. For example, the user needs to be able to access the game from different operating systems. For this I recommended an HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end, which means almost all web browsers can access the web application. Also, the client (operating system) will never have to see the backend code, as it will be hosted in the cloud. I chose the cloud because I feel that this was the most versatile option, and allowed redundancy across multiple regions.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
